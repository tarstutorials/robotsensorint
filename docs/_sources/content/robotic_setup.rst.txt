In these tutorials we will be using the Kinova 7DoF Gen3 Robotic arm. To learn more about it you can check out Kinova's `Gen3 <https://www.kinovarobotics.com/product/gen3-robots>`_ about page.

To connect the robot to a computer you will want to use the Kinova Kortex `API <https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kortex>`_.
