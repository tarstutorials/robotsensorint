Introduction to the course
===================================================
The purpose of this site is to provide a crash course in combining physiological sensing with robotics applications. 
We begin by introducing the basics of the Kinova Gen3 API, including how to set up and communicate with the robot. 
Once you are comfortable with the robotic platform, we shift focus to real-world physiological sensors and how to integrate them into robotic applications.

First, you will learn how to set up and use the sensor API. 
From there, we will guide you through combining both systems, working with an example where the robot picks up an object and uses sensor-based thresholding to detect when it should release it into your hand.

While this course centers around the Kinova Gen3 robotic arm, the techniques and principles are applicable to a wide range of robotic systems. 
We hope you find this resource useful, and that you commit the time and effort to building your skills in these two rapidly growing fields.

Code for this wesbite can be found on our `Github page <https://github.com/tarstutorials/robotsensorint>`_.

Additionally, the robotic project used in the creation of this site have been uploaded to our GitHub page as well, at `robotsensorint <\https://github.com/Terascale-All-sensing-Research-Studio/robotsensorint>`_. 

.. note::
    This course assumes the reader has some prerequiste knowledge on programming. It will go in-depth into Python packages but will not cover the general Python knowledge needed.
