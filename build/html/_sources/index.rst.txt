Welcome to Robot Sensor Integration!
============================================================================================

This is a set of free online tutorials on integrating physiological sensing into Robotics applications.
These tutorials are intended for a wide audience --- from health care professionals with little programming experience, 
to software developers new to wearable health sensors, and students exploring opportunities in these rapidly expanding fields. 
While the examples focus on the Kinova Gen3 robotic arm, the concepts and methods can be adapted to work with virtually any robotic platform that provides an API, making this a flexible resource for a wide range of projects.
